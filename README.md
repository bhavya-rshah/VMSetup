# VMSetup

#Assignment 1 from ACIT 4640 project taken in the Winter 2019 term from BCIT's Computer Information Technology (CIT) program
#the site where the original VM images in the code are hosted is no longer up and therefore would need to be modified with new or your own VM images

The VM Set up was an assignment to demonstrate the skills of Infrastructure as Code. By managing infrastructure through programmable scripts we worked to set up a fresh VM
with a CENTOS Linux operating system. We then added php, maria db, nginx, and wordpress to simulate adding web and db capability. Predominantly we scripted the WP_Setup.sh file and the
wp_vm_setup.sh file. Virtual Box was used for the virtual machine.
